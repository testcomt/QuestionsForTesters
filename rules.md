# Questions For Testers

To trigger conversations and build connections.

Make a group. Distribute cards. Take turns. Each turn, one of you reads a question, and its options, out loud â€“ then chooses one option, privately.

The reader may give points to anyone who predicts (or sways) their choice.

Points are pointless.


NB: Everyone can give the reason for their choices, if they like. Some people may be open to persuasion.

## Alternatives
* read a question to a group, hear what everyone's answer is.
* build a persona from answers
* two (or more) groups each build a persona without looking at questions or answers, then play adversarially based on described persona. Adjudicator awards points (which remain pointless) for humanity.
* use as questions (and answers) in a mock interview (radio, not job)
* as Jeopardy: read answers, offer questions
* look for common patterns behind the collection of cards, and spot gaps
* add answers
* add questions
